9    Use double quotes can automatically deal with single quotes in string, 
     which is also suitable for using single quotes handling double quotes.
     Or simple use "\" in front of quotes in string.
(Such as "print("I'm OK now. Let's go!")" 
or "print('"Life is short, you need python."')"
or "print("\"Let\'s go!\""))

10   Use raw string to ingore the function of "\".
(such as "print(r"C:\Desktop\Python")")

11   Only when "\" exists in the end can wrapping using "enter". 
     And using triple quotes can acheive this.
(such as "print("
          1            \n\
        1   1          \n\
     1    2    1       \n\
  1    3    3    1     \n\
)" or "print("""\
          1            
        1   1          
     1    2    1      
  1    3    3    1     
""")")

12   Use "+" to connect two string together 
     or use "*" to repeat a string many times.
(such as "'520'+'1314'" or ""I love you!\n"*100")
